c. I'm most excited about finally learning about Big O notation; it's something I haven't had a chance to look into yet, and I kept hearing others in my engineering classes recite the "Big O" or talk about it otherwise, leaving me confused as to what they were saying.
I'm also interested in learning more about how I can make my code more efficient, as well as gaining more knowledge about algorithms in general. The topics listed in the zyBook all seem equally as interesting, and I'm intrigued to learn more about how those topics all conect together.
